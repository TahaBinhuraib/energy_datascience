# Hourly energy market Full analysis repo

As we approach real-time, we want to develop a model that accurately forecast the price formed in the
equilibrium market based on the conditions of a particular day and day-ahead market forecasts.
The aim of this project is to develop a price, demand forecasting model by focusing on renewable energy
sources and examining the day-ahead electricity generation and output of these renewable energy sources
by taking into account the changeable weather conditions.

**We will be tackling this problem as a time series analysis forecasting**
