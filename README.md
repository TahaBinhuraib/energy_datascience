# Hourly energy market Full Analysis
As we approach real-time, we want to develop a model that accurately forecasts the price formed in the
equilibrium market based on the conditions of a particular day and day-ahead market forecasts.
This project aims to develop balance, price, and demand forecasting models focusing on renewable energy sources. While also examining the day-ahead electricity generation and the output of these renewable energy sources by considering the changeable weather conditions.

**We will be tackling this problem as a time series analysis forecasting**
